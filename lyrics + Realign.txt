you
think
it'll
never

know
yourself
not
a
clone

a

me
throw
my

everyone
you

why'd
you
give
me

you
gotta
learn

rules
when
you're
back
in

really
wanna
go

i
know
it
won't
last
much
longer
bound

down
with

another
opportunity
you
better
take
a
step
forward
throw
away
that
old
excuse
because
you'll
find
that
it's
something
intangible
that
makes
the
time
and
the
effort
worth
the
trouble
of
going
through
i
wish
you
luck
along
the
way
\//
so
i
got
a
little
older
i
got
everything
i
thought
i'd
need
i
got
a
little
wiser
but
i'm
not
everything
i
thought
i'd
be
think
you'd
be
better
off
in
bed
reliving
the
past
inside
your
head
no
i
don't
have
a
lot
to
leave
and
i'm
not
good
enough
to
was
it
worth
the
time
you
spent
i
don't
think
so
was
it
worth
the
time
that
went
i
told
you
so
was
it
worth
the
time
you
spent
i
don't
think
so
could
have
been
worse
is
what
you
said
so
i
got
another
concept
i
think
it's
my
best
idea
in
years
gonna
work
a
little
harder
gonna
give
it
the
very
best
of
me
think
of
all
the
shit
that
came
and
went
you'd
think
it's
the
wheel
you'd
reinvent
i
guess
i'll
throw
it
all
away
because
i'm
not
good
enough
to
was
it
worth
the
time
you
spent
i
don't
think
so
wasn't
worth
the
time
that
went
i
told
you
so
was
it
worth
the
time
you
spent
i
don't
think
so
could
have
been
worse
is
what
you
said
sounds
like
the
notes
you
played
were
wrong
and
you
should
give
up
before
too
long
but
if
i
pretend
to
believe
that
i'm
good
enough
to
was
it
worth
the
time
you
spent
i
do
think
so
it
was
worth
the
time
i
spent
it
was
i
know
it
was
worth
the
time
it
was
worth
the
time
and
now
the
voice
is
fucking
dead

me
a

had
it
all
figured
out

in
a
forest
past
the
harvest
lived
a
troll
named
drizzle
drozzle
dum
his
obsession
with
possession
led
him
to
an
awfully
tragic
end
one
bright
morning
after
yawning
drizzle
drozzle
stole
a
goblin's
lunch
he
was
hungry
and
his
tummy
gave
the
signal
for
him
to
have
a
munch
tasty
snail
stew
quite
tough
to
chew
drizzle
ate
well
then
he
went
to
bed
dreams
of
dragons
gnomes
and
half-lings
elven
woodsmen
began
to
fill
his
head
soon
the
goblin
to
his
chagrin
found
his
food
was
taken
by
the
troll
so
he
set
out
there
was
no
doubt
maimed
poor
drizzle
hung
him
from
a
pole
drizzle
drozzle
got
his
fulfill
but
his
actions
led
him
to
his
fall
that's
his
story
and
i'm
sorry
if
you
can
relate
to
him

all

never
hurt
no

now
i
need
shelter
from
the
raging
desert
sun
dragging
my
bones
to
the
side
of
the
road
pounding
in
my
head
so
loud
it
could
explode
i'm

i
say
yeah
escaping
into
vice
in
the
city
in
the

what
i
threw
away
is
right
back
in
my

lost
a
lot
of
time
in
the
land
of
the
drought
chasing
down
a

that
i
could
not

without
desert's
gone

can't
believe
my

this

i
found
a

instead
yesterday
was
so
adoring
my
god
so
easy
to
offend
i
would
rather
fly
than
fight
close
my

i feel the bitter of the cold
i'm feeling better on the outside
i think i'm better left alone
feeling better on the outside
think i'm better on the outside
i really mean it i really really mean it when i say
it's hard to see it in every single one that i know
i really mean it i really really mean it when i say
i tried to leave it and altogether stop on my own
some things are better left unknown
i'm no better on the outside
i feel the bitter of the cold
a little better on the outside
i really mean it i really really mean it when i say
it's sad to see it in every single one that you know
you can't defeat it if nobody lends you a hand
you can't redeem it if you're all alone
cause there's no stopping you and me
we need a new horizon that we work to reach
shared responsibility
never motivated by a threat or three
isolated from the dream
you got a healthy limit but it's hard to keep
separate reality
gotta make amends with what we used to be
\\\\\\\\\\
we had a bit of a fall on the way down
you feel hit by a car and your guilty
we had a little bit more than a breakdown
and now you're walking along in a daydream
now it's just a little bit closer now
now it's all a little bit harder now harder now
there's a bit of us all in the breakdown
you want a piece of the world with your ice cream
you're gonna be number one in a let down
when everything's moving on and you still hold out
it's just a little bit closer now
now it's all a little bit harder now harder now
\\\\\\\\\\/
far from the earth far from the sky we are no other
out in the dark a lone speck of light all our creation
if we're the only thing that matters then all we'll leave behind
this little dot you'd barely find
we barely crawl we try to fly we're all still children
no two the same yet all alike we are worth saving
we are the only thing that matters inside our little minds
we are the ones we leave behind
you are the moonlight on a mountain
a grain of sand upon the beach
you are the dream that lasts forever
are you the best that you can be
are we furthest from the mind of a creator
if all the world's not by design this is our future
we need a reason we should matter and if we use our heads
we'll leave the lights on after bed
you are the moonlight on a mountain
you are a wave upon the sea
you picked a time that really matters
don't fuck it up for you and me

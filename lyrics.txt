Got a new woman
Found her in an old bar
Got me a woman, baby
And took her back to my car

There she goes in the morning
There she goes in the morning sun
There she goes in the evening
There she goes when the day is, day is done

Got another woman
I found her on my new phone
Really should see her photos
Too bad they weren't her own

There she goes in the morning
There she goes in the morning sun
There she goes in the evening
There she goes when the day is, day is done

Got a new woman
Found her in a trash can
Think this is the woman, baby, I really do
Better tell my hand

There she goes in the morning
There she goes in the morning sun
There she goes in the evening
There she goes when the day is, day is done

Was on the news today, gotta stay afraid
Just leave it alone
We're going green to red said the talking head
It's out of control
They got a war machine but it's going green
I don't even know
They got another minion with no real opinion
Taking the fall
And I'm telling myself
That I'm going to hell
I'm going to hell
Yeah yeah yeah

I feel like an atom bomb
Blowing me out of my mind
Can't take it anymore
Tearing me from the inside
Feel like an atom bomb
Blowing me out of my mind
Can't take it anymore anymore anymore anymore

Another small reminder from the daily grinder
Just leave me alone
I got an invitation to the renovation
But nothing gets done
You're either on one end or you're not a friend
There's no middle road
It's in the tunnel vision that affects decision
We're down in a hole
And we're telling ourselves
That we're going to hell
We're going to hell
Yeah yeah yeah

I feel like an atom bomb
Blowing me out of my mind
Can't take it anymore
Tearing me from the inside
Feel like an atom bomb
Blowing me out of my mind
Can't take it anymore anymore anymore anymore
Feel like an atom bomb atom bomb atom bomb atom bomb
Can't take it anymore anymore anymore anymore
Feel like an atom bomb atom bomb atom bomb atom bomb
Can't take it anymore anymore anymore anymore

Watch me throw my life away, just for you, now I feel it's here to stay
Every time I close my eyes, I can see all the things I wanted to be
Take a piece there's not much left, but I feel that there's something more to say

We had a little talk

Got your reasons, got your code, and I know that you think it'll never change
Take the time to know yourself, not a clone or a fraction of someone else

We had a little talk

Whatever you do, don't you throw your life away
Whatever you do, don't you give your life away
Whatever you do, don't you turn turn your back on me
Don't you give your life away

Watch me throw my words away to wind, do we change or we stay the same
After all that's been and done, it was you I always running from

We had a little talk
///
I wake up on my own
But I don't wanna go
A million things to do
When I go back to school
I caught another glance
Could be a second chance
I'm drawing in my notes
I wanna go back home

Look out of the window
And doubt everyone you know
I really wanna go
But I know it won't last much longer
Found what you want to be
It's now just a memory
I really wanna leave
But I know it won't last much longer

Half the day is done
I'll meet you after lunch
Throw me to the curb
Nothing hurts like words
You said you had my back
So why'd you give me flack
You gotta learn the rules
When you're back in school

Look out of the window
You doubt everyone you know
I really wanna go
But I know it won't last much longer
Bound personalities
Down with your silly dreams
I really wanna leave
But I know it won't last much longer

Look out of the window
And doubt everyone you know
I really wanna go
But I know it won't last much longer
I feel like a weirdo
I guess I'll never know
I really wanna go
But I know it won't last much longer
I know it won't last much longer
I know it won't last much longer
I know it won't last much longer

I caught you ringing on the telephone,
but you couldn't spit it out
I heard you sounding like a dial tone,
Marbles in your mouth

Remember that funny feeling you couldn't live without
And you couldn't see the vision, head all in the clouds
I caught you ringing on that telephone, but you couldn't spit it out
Remember that funny feeling you couldn't live without

I caught you saying that you're in control,
but your wheels are spinning out
And now I'm ringing on your telephone,
but you can't hear me shout

Remember that funny feeling you couldn't live without
And you couldn't see the vision, head all in the clouds
I caught you ringing on that telephone, but you couldn't spit it out
Remember that funny feeling you couldn't live without

Remember that funny feeling you couldn't live without
And you couldn't see the vision, head all in the clouds
I caught you ringing on the telephone, but you couldn't spit it out
Remember that funny feeling I'm gonna live without

You say your mind is never shut
But you've got everything locked up
You've got a sentimental feeling,
But you're under someone elses thumb

Gonna act this way, gonna think this way, gonna talk this way
Gonna be the same, gonna look away, gonna play this game
Gotta fit this way, gotta find a way, gonna throw away all the things you say
Never gonna change, gonna walk away to the next charade

Now you'll play the victim from the start
Show off your sacred, bleeding heart
You claim to know the path to healing
Empathy for all, but not for some

Gonna act this way, gonna think this way, gonna talk this way
Gonna be the same, gonna look away, gonna play this game
Gotta fit this way, gotta find a way, gonna 'splain away all the things you say
Never gonna change, gonna walk away to the next charade

Gonna act this way, gonna think this way, gonna talk this way
Gonna be the same, gonna look away, gonna play this game
Gotta fit this way, gotta find a way, gonna throw away all the things you say
Gonna change your name, before you take the stage, I'm gonna walk away
\/
I wish you luck along the way, I would have never told you, but I gotta say it's true
And if I'm wrong, along the way, I would have never told you cause I gotta play the fool
And now you got a problem with my company,
You found a little bit of trouble and you're out to sea, oh you
And if you got nothing but time to kill,
I get a back seat driver and a critic for my review

And if you're lost, along the way, you turn another corner till you find the path you choose
And if they scoff, along the way, you never let them tell you how to feel the way you do
And if you see another opportunity,
You better take a step forward, throw away that old excuse
Because you'll find that it's something intangible
That makes the time and the effort worth the trouble of going through

I wish you luck
Along the way

So I got a little older
I got everything I thought I'd need
I got a little wiser
But I'm not everything I thought I'd be
Think you'd be better off in bed
Reliving the past inside your head
No I don't have a lot to leave
And I'm not good enough to

Was it worth the time you spent?
I don't think so
Was it worth the time that went?
I told you so
Was it worth the time you spent?
I don't think so
Could have been worse is what you said

So I got another concept
I think it's my best idea in years
Gonna work a little harder
Gonna give it the very best of me

Think of all the shit that came and went
You'd think it's the wheel you'd reinvent

I guess I'll throw it all away
Because I'm not good enough to

Was it worth the time you spent?
I don't think so
Wasn't worth the time that went?
I told you so
Was it worth the time you spent?
I don't think so
Could have been worse is what you said

Sounds like the notes you played were wrong
And you should give up before too long
But if I pretend to believe
That I'm good enough to

Was it worth the time you spent?
I do think so
It was worth the time I spent
It was I know
It was worth the time
It was worth the time
And now the voice is fucking dead

I got you a job in the city now
But what you want isn't what you found,
Such a frown

We're taking the bus and you're going downtown
Bet you tried to burn this opportunity down,
To the ground

So sorry, so sad
You've got it, so bad
Your friends are, in the band,
Still playing

I got you a job in the city now
Slaving all day for your pennies now,
Should be proud


When I was young the sweat fell off of my brow
Got me a car and I bought me a house
When I was younger, I had it all figured out
And that you're older, there should never be a doubt

I want you to notice
I want you to notice
I want you to know just what I've done for you x2

So sorry, so sad
You've got it, so bad
Your friends are, in the band,
Still playing

I got you a job in the city now
It's time to come down from the top of that cloud,
Come on down

You're punching the clock for twenty odd years now
Above and beyond, but still on the ground
Take a bow

You got it, you're in
You're selling, your skin
Goodbye to, the boys
Put away, the toys

She missed the beat on the day of the week she was born

Using, always something, it's something
That you tell yourself all the way, all the way
Gotta go sometime, always losing,
You're losing a part of yourself everyday, everyday
Gotta go somewhere, always something,
It's something that you tell yourself
All the way, all the way... to the morgue

I've been writing on your ghost page babe
I've been waiting by your grave
Once upon a time I watched you fall
It was written on your wall

Rain hell, rain it on top of me
Cause right now, no one is stopping me
Rain hell, rain it on top of me
Cause right now, nothing is stopping me

I've been writing on your ghost page babe
And I would check it every day
We'll be together till the end of time
I'll be scrolling through your shrine

Rain hell, rain it on top of me
Cause right now, no one is stopping me
Rain hell, rain it on top of me
Cause right now, nothing is stopping me

And every time, that I feel afraid
Afraid of what I'll say
I towed the line and now I'm alone
It doesn't mean I don't belong

It's hard to believe you
when you say
I'll never leave you
I could be wrong,
but it's been a long, lonely night

And any time
That I feel the pain,
Out in the pouring rain
You told a lie
and now I'm alone
I couldn't see when I was wrong

It's hard to believe you
when you say
I'll never leave you
I could be wrong,
but it's been a long, lonely night

And any time, that I feel afraid
Afraid of what you'll say

Once, I dreamt I wasn't far away from you
You, irradiate the sky you fell into
And I just couldn't believe it, I was changed or deranged
Now, am I the one who's head is in the ground

But I don't know what any of this means to me
Turn out the lights and it's all so clear to see
All of this time I was holding out it seems
Go back to bed and I'll meet you in a dream

You, when any other voice would make me blue
And you, you complicate the life you stepped into
And I just couldn't receive it, I was closed, predisposed
Now, am I the one who ran away from you

But I don't know what any of this means to me
Turn out the lights and it's all so clear to see
All of this time I was holding out it seems
Go back to bed and I'll meet you in a dream

But I don't know what any of this means to me
Turn out the lights and it's all so clear to see
All of this time I was holding out it seems
Go back to bed and I'll meet you in a dream
I don't know when I would see your face again
Brighter than all of the smiles that came and went
You fell like a star in the Milky Way back when
But when you're a dream, you can't make it to the end

In a forest, past the harvest, lived a troll named Drizzle Drozzle Dum
His obsession with possession led him to an awfully tragic end
One bright morning, after yawning, Drizzle Drozzle stole a goblin's lunch
He was hungry and his tummy gave the signal for him to have a munch

Tasty snail stew, quite tough to chew, Drizzle ate well then he went to bed
Dreams of dragons, gnomes and half-lings, elven woodsmen began to fill his head
Soon the goblin, to his chagrin, found his food was taken by the troll
So he set out, there was no doubt, maimed poor Drizzle, hung him from a pole

Drizzle Drozzle got his fulfill, but his actions led him to his fall
That's his story and I'm sorry if you can relate to him at all

Turn the page and start to write
The world won't wait for procrastination
You'll never bleed if you never fight
But how much worth the pain is elation
Part the sea and release the skies
The future's brighter than you'll ever know

If you ever frame your mind and see it all, in another light

Follow through in the face of ire
Turn away from feigned aberration
Define the rules by a state of mind
Don't give in to cheap imitation
Change the scene to a better vibe
We need it more than you'll ever know

If you ever frame your mind and see it all, in another light
\\\
Late last night or was it morning
Outside the rain was pouring
I stumbled out I hit the ground
It's a hell of a scene but there's no story
Designed in all it's glory
To set you up and knock you down

Just a reflection on my bitterness
Why plant the seed and not do the rest?
Just a distraction from the meaningless
I'd rather bleed than settle for less

Was told at the time to just keep going
You'll fly but don't stop rowing
Reached for the moon and hit the ground
Is this a chip upon my shoulder?
As heavy as a boulder?
When all the world owes you a crown

Just a reflection on my emptiness
You don't succeed by chasing success
No reputation is worth all this mess
I'd rather bleed than settle for less

Just a reflection on my happiness
Only compete with yourself at your best
A separation from the self I possess
Just let it be and settle for less
\\\/
You gotta live a little, you gotta give a little
We've got a long cold history
If I seem uncomfortable it's because you're just too close to me
Past the living room, a rose-tinted tomb
And a ghost staring back at me
If it seems impossible it's because you dont believe

Memories Lie

In a little while, I'll be out of style
Out of grace and reality
When I feel disposable I'll pretend it meant something to me
Everyone you see, passing on the street
Plays a part in a tragedy
When it's too uncomfortable it can rewrite history

Memories Lie

Try to see it from another angle
Memories can change with passing time
You believe it when it's all too painful
Now you need it just to feel alright

Try to see it from another angle
Try to see it in another light
Memories can lie when they're too painful
Now you need it just to feel alright
Just to feel alright

I've been watching, I've been waiting, I've been ready, won't you tell me? Maybe?
I've been watching, I've been waiting, I've been patient, won't you tell me? Maybe?
Tell me?

Now I've been going it alone
A broken heart is just the start of what it is that could go wrong
The pride I fake hangs like a stone
I want you to tell me

I've been running in slow motion
With every year another fear I've pushed as far as I can go
And I've been blinded by that notion
I want you to tell me

I want you to tell me
Maybe
Where I need to go
I want you to help me
Tell me
What I need to know

I've been trying but my hands are tied
Am I running out of road?
Am I victim of my own design?
And I can't help wondering if I'm running out of time

I want you to help me
Tell me
What I need to know
I want you to help me

I'm so happy; I'm so happy for you
If you're happy, then I guess I'm happy for you

You're so funny, and they love everything that you do
And since you're happy, you could never be blue
(It's all a lie; it's not real
You're doing fine; it's no big deal)

I'm so happy (it's all a lie)
I'm so happy for you (it's not real)
If you're happy (you're doing fine)
I guess I'm happy for you (it's no big deal)
Cause you've got everything you want, but I'm overdue

(Get Down) Onto the cold hard floor
(Break down) Shaking me to the core
(Stay down) What am I waiting for
Cause I'm not happy for you
(Lights out) After your party's done
(No doubt) I'm thinking you've had your fun
(Break down) How come I'm still so bummed?
Cause I'm not happy for you
I tried but I never came through
I wish I was happy for you

I'm so sad cause I never ever really had the right to be
And I'm so sad cause I never wanna know just what you think of me
I'm so sad that I'm ranting and raving at an empty wall
I'm so sad cause the way to lift myself up is to see you fall

I wont let it go, won't ever grow, wanna let you know, that I'm feeling low,
So I'm in control, and you listen, close to the overflow that I'm feeling

I'm so sad cause I never ever really had the right to be
And I'm so sad and I don't have any real accountability
I'm so sad that I'm telling everybody all around the world
And I'm so sad that I can't tell everybody in the universe

I'm unhappy, when you're happy, because I'm sadly alone,
and madly in love with feeling afraid, so I behave like a child, and I am reviled

Even brave people break when they're up against a tidal wave
Even brave people break when they're up against a tidal wave

I'm so sad that I'm ranting and I'm raving at an empty wall
I'm so sad cause the way to lift myself up is to see you fall

I'm unhappy, when you're happy, because I'm sadly alone,
and I badly bemoan my place in this life, don't want your advice,
don't know who I am, and I'm feeling...

Ooh, Have I been awake too long?
Aah, I'm taking this way too far
Have I been awake too long?

And then it hits me somewhere right between the eyes
Because I know the cost of time, and I've paid it all my life

Near or far, no matter how close you are
Hopelessly united in entropy
Could it be, the presence of memory
Is all we are, and all that we'll ever be?

Have I been awake too long?
I'm taking this way too far
Have I been awake too long?

And then I tell myself it's just so far away
Back to the old routine that fills my every day
Some pray the holy ghost will save them from the grave
But I know the cost of time, and I've paid it all my life

Your star is bright and glowing
You had so much to show me
No matter where you're going
Your star is bright and glowing

The less you say the more you show
The less you show the more you disappear
A part of you is all we know
A part of you is in the atmosphere

You got a message from the stars
A transmission through the stratosphere
Was it a daydream born on Mars
A sound or vision from a future year?

Your star is bright and glowing
You had so much to show me
No matter where you're going
Your star is bright and glowing

Felt like a notion from the one
You turn the lights on and it disappears
You radiate just like the sun
A fire burns although the spark is gone

You got a message through the stratosphere
A part of you is in the atmosphere
You got a message through the stratosphere
Burn like a star and then you disappear

Don't leave us stranded here
Don't leave us stranded here
Don't ever disappear
Don't ever disappear
You've got a message through the stratosphere

I keep it together, but you fucked me up
A rip in the tether to knock me off course
Is it for better or is it for worse?
I don't know

Thanks for the memories, thanks for the times
I took what you gave to me and then made it mine
A drift on the river but riding the tide,
Still afloat

The wings of a butterfly, a skip of the stone
If it would've gone the way I thought it would go
I could be shoveling shit to pay loans
I don't know

I woke real tired with the earth for a bed
Can't remember nothing but the colors black and red

Well a little bit of fun never hurt no one
Now I need shelter from the raging desert sun

Dragging my bones to the side of the road
Pounding in my head so loud it could explode

I'm heading on back to Reno
On the way, all the way
Heading on back to Reno
Every day, get away
Heading on back to Reno
And I say yeah

Escaping into vice in the city in the sand
But what I threw away is right back in my hand

Lost a lot of time in the land of the drought
Chasing down a feeling that I could not live without

Desert's gone cold in the dark of the night
Looking to the distance I can see a bit of light
Is it light?

I'm heading in back to Reno
On the way, all the way
Heading on back to Reno
Every day, get away
Heading on back to Reno
And I say yeah

Made myself a little garden to grow myself my only friends
Got myself a brand new start and, oh no I screwed it up again
Guess I'm staying up all night; in my mind, but out of sight

I'm to blame for this, I hide away until the day is through
I will pay for this, won't find a way to push the blame on you
I won't run from this; hide away until the day is through

Can't believe my eyes this morning; I found a plot of weeds instead
Yesterday was so adoring; my god, so easy to offend
I would rather fly than fight; close my eyes and hang on tight

I'm not to blame for this, I hide away until the day is through
I will run from this, I'll find a way to push to blame on you
I'll be all right tomorrow, hide away until the day is through

It's so simple, It's as easy as can be
Make a monster; lock it up, throw away the key

In the backyard, buried deep underneath the tree
There's a monster taking root in the property
In the garden, where the weeds are now growing free
In the garden, where my friends plot to bury me
There's a jungle, it's as far as the eye can see
Overgrown now, it's no longer a fantasy
But it's too late, by the time that I realize
I can't see now, cause the dirt is up to my eyes
\\\\\
And if you don't find what you've been looking for you've got to learn to forgive and forget
And if you can't get up off the cold hard floor you've got to learn to forgive and forget
And If you can't find what you've been living for you've got to learn to forgive and forget
And if you can't let go of your dirty thought you've got to learn to forgive and forget
And if you can't get over your broken heart you've got to learn to forgive and forget
And if you don't know how you got this far you've got to learn to forgive and forget
And if there's no hope left of a another start, you've got to learn to forgive yourself
\\\\\/
You can throw your conscience away just to land a good part in the play
Maybe there's a reason that you feel so empty
Broken bottles and junk on the floor; its hard to notice when your eye's on the score
If you burn a picture to obtain the ashes, a bit of wind could blow what's left away

You can leave your heart at the door; you can waste all your time wanting more
You can play a victim to a broken mirror
You can sell yourself for a dime; step on anyone who borrows your time
You can be a hero to your own reflection, you can fill your head with empty praise
If you burn a picture to obtain the ashes, you resign to throw yourself away

There's another light...

Alone and stranded, out of time
Are you receiving me alright?

Out in the cold Arcturan night
Why are you leaving me behind?

Lost to the void, all sense of time
Was there no meaning to my life?

The air I breathe is running dry
Don't think I'll last another night

I can't hear you if you're calling out my name
I can't see you and I'm feeling just the same
I can't see you, I can't hear you, I'll believe it when I die

When I was young, I dreamed I'd fly
I wish I'd had the nerve to try

I see my life before my eyes
All that I've loved and I've despised

I can't hear you if you're calling out my name

Well I'm a million miles away, from the whos and whys that used to matter, throw it all away, you could throw it all away

If I had just one more day, I would speak my mind, goodbye forever, all I have to say, and I'd mean all that I'd say

And to those that I've betrayed, before I close my eyes and sleep forever, Sorry for the pain, but you might've done the same

And I'd thank you for today, and for all the moments not remembered, wish I could repay, but you're a million miles away

This is the captain of the Pike
Are you receiving me alright

I haven't settled on a meaning, (meaning)
Of what it is that defines me, (defines me)

It's hard to think when you're trying to float

I got a feeling it will all work out

There's no going back 

How unusual
Something's changing in spite of me
All I've never known
Will piece together in front of me 

I got a feeling it will all work out
I got a feeling it will all work out
I got a feeling it will all work out
I got a feeling it will all work out 

I put myself in a little box
It's got a window and a breathing hole
And when it rains, I go for a swim
I might get out if it reaches the top 

I got a feeling it will all work out
I'm on the right track
There's no going back 

How unusual
Something's changing in spite of me
All I've never known
Will piece together in front of me 

I got a feeling it will all work out
I got a feeling it will all work out
I got a feeling it will all work out
I got a feeling it will all work out 

I'm not the crash on the side of the road
I'm not the people who define me, (define me)
I'm not the reason for the hole in your ground
You set the scene and it surprised you, (surprised you) 

I got a feeling it will all work out
I'm on the right track
There's no going back
With all the right words
From all the wrong days
From all the old ways
A handful of change
To spend on myself
To play a new game
\\\\\////
Have I been facing the wrong way, baby?
I gotta turn it around
I gotta foot in the door, just maybe
I'm tired of kidding myself 

Is this just a dream, am I freaking out?
Don't let me go, don't leave me out
It's not a dream 

Think I'm doing alright by myself
I've been doing alright by myself
I've been doing alright by myself
It's what I'm trying to tell myself 

Don't take this the wrong way, baby
I've gotta slow it all down
I'm sick of taking the shortcut, maybe
There ain't no easy way out 

Is this just a dream, 'cause I'm freaking out
Don't let me go, don't leave me out
I'm not going away, I'm not burning out
Leave me alone, or I'll shut you out
I'm not freaking out 

'Cause I've been doing alright by myself
I've been doing alright by myself
I've been doing alright by myself
It's what I'm trying to tell myself

Never got around desire
Never felt complete
Doused in oil, and tried by fire
But never to be clean 

Kerosene
Kerosene
Kerosene
Kerosene 

So throw another on the fire
Turn in your humanity
Apology is uninspired
So hang 'em from the tree 

Kerosene
Kerosene
Kerosene
Kerosene

Animals around the pyre
Gather for the feast
To look upon the new messiah
But the flame is all that's seen 

Kerosene
Kerosene
Kerosene
Kerosene 

Rejected by the purifier
And chosen by the beast
The ones who really lit the fire
Start to show their teeth

It's just a little bit funny how we regress
Spillin' out like a flood, all we repress
We get a whole lot of reasons to shake the blame
If you can't fix your own problem, just change its name 

Are we running to forget?
Are we running from regret?
Are we running to forget?
'Cause there's not a lot of common sense 

Is there a little bit of danger on the road?
I feel more like a stranger in my own home
No one makes a mistake, no one cops to a lie
You can't pull your own weight if you never try 

Are we running to forget?
Are we running from regret?
Are we running to forget?
'Cause there's not a lot of common sense 

All your past transgressions are etched in time
There's no second chances when you've crossed the line
Play for the money, play for the team
Is this the very last gasp of a dying dream? 

Are we running to forget?
Are we running from regret?
Are we running to forget?
'Cause there's not a lot of common sense

Reeling again
With back against the wall
Don't look down, don't be afraid to fall
Lost and found and barely hanging on
Made a big sound 

But you never had a reason, oh
And you're never gonna win, no
Feeling low
The penalty of sin, oh
Leave it alone
Cause we're never gonna win, no
Feeling goes 

Breathe

Lies don't last long
You spread yourself too thin
Then you're gone, believing your own shit
Won't be long 'til they're pulling on your string
Then it's done 

'Cause you never had a reason, oh
And you're never gonna win, no
Feeling low
The penalty of sin, oh
Leave it alone
'Cause we're never gonna win, no
Feeling goes
\\\\\\///
When the coldest year gets colder
Where you gonna run?
When your heavy heart gets older
Did you have your fun? 

Got a heavy little heart
Inside you
You got a heavy little heart
Beside you 

When the people that believe you
Grow tired of the silence
And the fear that wants to see you
Is hiding 'round the bend 

Got a heavy little heart
Inside you
You got a heavy little heart
Beside you 
\\\\\\////
Well I'm sorry that it's over
But I know no other way
You could leave it, or believe it
But there's nothing it would change 

Well I tried to get away
But I just can't seem to lose the taste
Through virtue or through pain
These memories will make the man they break 

Please don't leave me with no other way
Please just leave me alone
I'm trying to get lost
But I don't know the way
So please just leave me alone
Alone

Well I don't know you, but I owe you
So much more than can be paid
Self-defeated, and deleted
But through this I still remain

Well I tried to find a way
To resolve the past with life today
And all that I became
Is the best of what's been thrown away

Please don't leave me with no other way
Please just leave me alone
I'm trying to get lost
But I can't find the way
So please just leave me alone
Alone
Alone

Why die on a hill?
Why live for yourself?
If there's a meaning, lost it long ago
Digging out a hole to throw another soul
And here's a secret:
We're not all just one thing
Whatever that may bring, it's better than the brink 

Why die on a hill?
Why live in a hell?
If there's a reason for the other side
Is it yours or mine?
Getting out of line
Conversation shouldn't be left out
Or leave you with a doubt that you're a human being 

We've been divided by quotients
Separated by pain
Indivisible torment
To take you out of the game 

We're on a new rotation
Where no one else can play
We're on a new rotation
Provided by our hate 

We're on a new vibration
We're in another phase
We're on a new vibration
Divided by our hate 

Why die on a hill?
\\\\\\\/
One last chance, one more try
One last work straight through the night
One more cry, one last fit
Do or die, and getting sick 

Uh oh, you're gonna put yourself in the corner
Uh oh, you've gone and done it wrong again 

Listen close, make it quick
Overflow their heads with shit
Spit it out, make a scene
Wonder why they shit on me? 

Uh oh, you're gonna put yourself in the corner
Uh oh, you've gone and done it wrong again 

At the top is only one way down
There's one way down
There's one way down
At the top you've got a bigger mouth to feed

At the top there's only one way down
There's one way out
No doubt about it
At the top you've got a bigger head to feed 

When in doubt, when in need
There's no time to disagree
With yourself when you scheme
All you are is kerosene 

Uh oh, you're gonna put yourself in the corner
Uh oh, you've gone and done it wrong again 

At the top is only one way down
There's one way down
There's one way down
At the top you've got a bigger mouth to feed 

At the top is only one way down
There's one way out
No doubt about it
At the top you've got a bigger head to feed 
To feed
Feed
Feed 

If you want it
Go and get it
Reputation
Adulation

Expectation
Complications
The temptation
Isolation

She always looked at me
Through the cemetery window
She made a life of me
And it turned me off of feeling 

Now, she took me by surprise
I never had the notice
I couldn't realize that there always was a window
An ordinary window 

She taught her spite to me
And I never even noticed
She tried to talk to me
But I didn't want to notice 

Sleep pushing down on me
But I just can't close my eyes
To sacrifice 

Leave never to be seen
Pain is never make believe
In paradise

On my own, on my time, all I'm leaving is a past behind
For my soul, for my mind, all I need is what I'm yet to find

How low will this one go?
How long will this one be around and come to despise me?
How far will this one go?
How long does this go on and on and on

On my own, on my time, all I'm leaving is a past behind
For my soul, for my mind, all I need is what I'm yet to find

And I know you never pulled my arm, believe you me
But the only way to do no harm, is to leave, leave, leave

How far does this one go? (don't wanna hear about it, don't wanna hear about it)
How hard is it to keep in mind that life isn't ending?
How long will this one stay? (don't wanna hear about it, don't need to know about it)
How long does this goes on and on and on and on

And you know I never meant no harm, believe you me
But the only way to do no wrong, is to leave, leave, leave

On my own, on my time, all I needed was the peace of mind
Off the phone, off the line, there's a better way to spend the time
On my own, on my time, all I'm leaving is a past behind
For my soul, for my mind, all I need's a little peace of mind
All I'm leaving is a past behind
All I need's a little peace of mind

So tell me, tell me, why can't this be easy?
I've heard it once, I've heard it all before
So settle down, relax yourself completely
You can't get down if you're always in control

Here out so far, it's a long way, long way back
I've never been so far before
Here out so far, it's a long way, long way back
I've never been so far before

So If you're wondering how you walk away
You bide your time and wait just like you do

Here out so far, it's a long way, long way back
I've never been so far before
Here out so far, it's a long way, long way back
I've never been so far before

So tell me, tell me, why can't this be easy?
You cry for help but there's no one at the door
It's hard to find your way when it's too easy
With all your doubt and lack of self control

They got you reeling from the rafters
And feeling farther from yourself
A simple feeling that you're after
But one that tears yourself apart

They got you reeling from the rafters
Until you feel it in your heart
But there's no pleasing the new masters
Outside of living in the dark

You close your eyes, you see them come to life
They know the way, their whispers cold and grey
And for a while, you find you're in denial for two
They got you reeling from the rafters
But there's still time to change your part
Chewing the scene just like an actor
While the whole building comes apart

You close your eyes, you see them come to life
They know the way, their whispers cold and grey
And for a while, you find you're in the human zoo
\\\\\\\\/
You are the reason this is happening
You are the reason this is happening
Who you are is the reason this is happening
You are, you are

When you put it in check, but you get it in cash
When your days are goin slow but you're traveling fast
When you're in the right lane, but you're on the wrong track
Gotta give it up, gotta take it out back

There's a radio drone up the side of your head
When you write it all down cause it can't be said

You are, you are, you are
You are the reason this is happening
Who you are is the reason this is happening
Gotta give it up

Cause you say it out loud doesn't make it mean jack
When you put yourself up, but you pull yourself back
When you're settled in stone, but it cracks
You gotta give it up, gotta take it out back
\\\\\\\\//
Well I could try my best to help but I don't know you
And there's only so much difference it could make
I could try my best to save you but I'm weighed down
If I push it any further I could sink

To see another breakdown
See you come apart
Really brings my world down
Really breaks my heart
You see them every day now
See em go too far
You know it's not too late now
For another start

I could try my best to help but does it matter
If you need someone you have to want to change
I could play that part and put it on my shoulder
But I do not have the discipline it takes

See you come apart now
To see you fall apart
Really brings my world down
Really breaks my heart
See you on the way down
But never for too long
There always was a way out
You knew it all along

Don't you wanna be someone forever
You can let them see you all the time
Don't you want to be, a great pretender
Don't you wanna be someone?

Did you ever feel afraid, did you ever feel the shame,
Did you ever feel the pain, did you ever feel it?
Did you ever rearrange, did you ever need to change,
Did you ever feel the same, did you ever feel it?

Don't you want to be someone but better
Don't you want to seem like you're divine
Leave a memory behind forever
Then you'll always be someone

Did you ever feel afraid, did you ever feel the shame,
Did you ever feel the pain, did you ever feel it?
Did you ever rearrange, did you ever need to change,
Did you ever feel the same, did you ever feel it?

I don't know where we're going to, with these eyes on me and these eyes on you
Make believe there's a point of view that you never lose when they come for you

I don't know what you want from me, what you're looking for, what I'm supposed to be
Maybe I just don't wanna see, what I mean to you, what you mean to me

Half sunk, the mighty face
These words upon the base
Nothing beside remains
Of the man who was born and died a king

Look on this mighty place
Now gone without a trace
Lost to the long decay
In the land of the valley of the king

Memory cloaked in shadow
Here the river runs shallow

All will be
Mystery
All will be
Remedied

Once sat upon the throne
What's left, made of stone
Ravaged, left to erode
By the winds of the valley of the king
None stand against the flow
How water smooths the stone
To pass all that we know
A demand of the spirit within
\\\\\\\\\
When you're here you're far away
When you're here you're far away
When you're here you're far away
When you're here

You can see it up above, down below, in the wake of the flow
You can see it in your highs, in your lows, let it teach, let it go

When you're here you're far away
When you're here

You can hear it in a sound, as you breathe, ebb and flow, float upstream
You can hear it in a laugh, in a scream, when you wake, from the dream
When you're here you're far away
When you're here you're far
When you're here you're far away
When you're here

You can feel it in the rain, in the field, as the green, is revealed
You can feel it on the grass, in the heat, to the cool, of the breeze
You can feel it in the glow, of the leaves, as they fall, from the trees
You can feel on a cold, winter eve, as the crows, fall asleep
\\\\\\\\\/
You know they won't be needed to return the call, if they're already gone
Believed to be receiving, could be too far gone, they're spiteful and withdrawn
Seems to be a consequence of feeling alone, don’t know where they belong

No they won't be leaving any time at all, content to look behind
Consuming and depleting everything around, but never satisfied
Now they'll be deciding who is worth the most, until they change their minds

If only they'd conceivably untie the knot of global suicide

You know they won't believe it if they see a ghost, you think they're ready for this?
No one even looks up at the stars anymore, who'd think they're not alone?
It wouldn't be impossible to save themselves, if only they would try
\\\\\\\\\//
They, they want you, to be afraid of everyone
They, they want you, to feel that way for good

But I don't mean to complain, I promise
What did you say, I couldn't hear
But I don't mean to complain, I promise
It didnt help to lend an ear

They, they want you, to be that way with everyone
They, they want you, to need to change, for them

But I don't mean to complain, I promise
What did you say, I couldn't hear
But I don't mean to complain, I promise
Whatever hell to pay is near

Well it started to hit you at a quarter to five,
the only thing left was the dopamine high

You started to wonder if your life was a lie
But who really cares when everything is on fire

So hello hello won't you go away, now go away
Hello hello won't you ever go away, now go

Some are in deep, some are up high
The cynical mind is always dissatisfied

Some are indifferent, some in denial
It's hard to complain but you try for a while

So hello hello won't you go away, now go away
Just ignore it, it'll go away, now go

It's just too boring make it go away, just go away
It's not important, let it go away, just go

Wake, from the dream

Hey, why do I feel this way
I can't remember
Hey, I'm ticking the time away
On anesthesia
Hey, why do I feel this way
I can't remember why I forgot my way

Wait, for a day or two
What's the rush, where's the world going to
Wake, from the dream
Don't you know, it's not always as it seems
Hey, why do I feel this way
I can't remember
Hey, I'm ticking the time away
On anesthesia
Hey, why do I feel this way
I can't remember why I forgot my place

I feel the bitter of the cold
I'm feeling better on the outside
I think I'm better left alone
Feeling better on the outside

Think I'm better on the outside

I really mean it, I really really mean it when I say
It's hard to see it in every single one that I know
I really mean it, I really really mean it when I say
I tried to leave it and altogether stop on my own

Some things are better left unknown
I'm no better on the outside
I feel the bitter of the cold

A little better on the outside

I really mean it, I really really mean it when I say,
It's sad to see it in every single one that you know
You can't defeat it if nobody lends you a hand
You can't redeem it if you're all alone

Cause there's no stopping you and me
We need a new horizon that we work to reach
Shared responsibility
Never motivated by a threat or three
Isolated from the dream
You got a healthy limit but it's hard to keep
Separate reality
Gotta make amends with what we used to be
\\\\\\\\\\
We had a bit of a fall on the way down,
You feel hit by a car and your guilty
We had a little bit more than a breakdown,
And now you're walking along in a daydream

Now, it's just a little bit closer now
Now, it's all a little bit harder now, harder now
There's a bit of us all in the breakdown,
You want a piece of the world with your ice cream
You're gonna be number one in a let down,
When everything's moving on and you still hold out

It's just a little bit closer now
Now, it's all a little bit harder now, harder now
\\\\\\\\\\/
Far from the earth, far from the sky, we are no other
Out in the dark, a lone speck of light, all our creation
If we're the only thing that matters, then all we'll leave behind
This little dot you'd barely find

We barely crawl, we try to fly, we're all still children
No two the same, yet all alike, we are worth saving
We are the only thing that matters, inside our little minds
We are the ones we leave behind

You are the moonlight on a mountain
A grain of sand upon the beach
You are the dream that lasts forever
Are you the best that you can be?

Are we furthest from the mind, of a creator
If all the world's not by design, this is our future
We need a reason we should matter, and if we use our heads
We'll leave the lights on after bed

You are the moonlight on a mountain
You are a wave upon the sea
You picked a time that really matters
Don't fuck it up for you and me
\\\\\\\\\\//
Go too far with your visions and afterthoughts
Play your part and then you leave all the rest to us

Now you know what a mess you’re in
Now you know where the rest begins

Go too far with your visions and afterthoughts
Say your part and then there'll be nothing left for us

Now you know what a mess you’re in

Been looking for something
In the middle of the street
An addictive devotion to feed

Well the cars are approaching
Coming at the wrong speed
And you feel that you're living and free

There's a will left to survive
And a lot more on my mind that isn't ordinary
It's a tradeoff I suppose
For the life I'll never own and never give to you

When the engines are running but the thrill is too cheap
What you needed to function, won't please

Now you don't see it coming and you won't feel the bleed
Better think of another person to be

There's a will left to survive
And a lot more on the line that isn't ordinary
It's a tradeoff I suppose
For the things I can’t control and never wanted to

There's a will left to survive
And a lot more on my mind that isn't ordinary
It's a tradeoff I suppose

Lead me, lead me by example
Reach me, on a higher level
Teach me, help me to remember
Leave me, it’s not what I’m after

Release me

Lead me by example
Lead me to the temple

Lead me, lead me to the temple
Reach me, said you have the answer
Teach me, in the great thereafter
Bleed me, bleed me til I'm stable

You never know, you should need to know by now
You never know, you should need to know by now
You’ll never turn, you’ll never turn me inside out
You’ll never turn, you’ll never turn me upside down
You’ll never burn, you're never gonna burn me out
You’ll never burn, you're never gonna burn it down
You never learn, you shouldn't need to know by now
\\\\\\\\\\\
Now wouldn't you know, you're choking on the spite
Now wouldn't you know, You're passing up your life

Cause you and me will never be alright
If you believe the words up in your mind

Now wouldn't you know, you’re setting your own fire, fire
Now wouldn’t you know, you’re unreasonably unkind, kind

Cause you and me will never be alright
If you believe the words up in your mind
Cause you and me will never be in line
If you perceive it all in black and white

Cause you and me will never be alright
If you believe a wrong can make a right
Cause you and me will never be in time
If you perceive it all in black and white

Eventual, land into the sea
Ephemeral, nature of the beast
Insatiable, desire leave me be
Uncomfortable, anyone but me

I think about it when life gets me down
I try to hide it, when I'm on the ground
I can't define it but I'm sorry I fell
I think about it

Escapable, but only in a dream
Delusional, but with a sense of peace
Intangible, a crack between the seams
Broken heart, the gift that seems to keep

Elessar, who I’d like to be
Fallen star, good enough for me
Valinor, the place where I would flee
Delusional, it's alright by me

I’ll read about it and live in my head
I dream about it when I’m feeling bad
It really matters when life gets your scared
It really matters

Open your eyes to the feeling you deny
Suffocate with a smile and then add it to the pile
An antithetical lie, better put yourself on trial
It's just a trick of the mind then you're gone

I could live forever
But where would I go
There's a place for every time you're alone

I can still remember
The production notes
There's a place for every wry anecdote
I know you know

Open your mind, when you feed the most unkind
Well you're leading the blind, but you know

I could leave forever, but where would I go
There's a place for every fight that you've flown

I could brave the weather
That I can't control
There's a place for every cry from the cold,
For every knife that you cloaked
For every mile that you drove
And every bump in the road
I know you know

I could live forever, but where would I go
There’s a place for every final repose

I could speak forever
But what would you know
There's a place for every blot of the soul
And every loss of control
For every lie to unfold
And sloppy line that you sold
For every mile that you drove
Just to feel farther from home
For every bump in the road
That same old cry from the cold
I know you know
\\\\\\\\\\\///
You started living with yourself for a while
You said you'd never suffer fools for a smile
But while you're living in the state of denial
Don't lose hope

You get an inch while they’re taking a mile
Can't erase what we use to describe
Words carry weight but they don't have a mind
Of their own
Of their own


It’s a bad, bad bad, place to be
Bad, bad bad, memory

Who gets to choose who will and who won't
Ooh there's a real good reason I don't

You started feeling out of sync with the lie
But try to speak it and you're out on exile
Why follow reason when you follow denial
And you float
Down you go

While everybody’s busy finding their side
Further apart but falling further in line
We’re going broke while they’re making a dime
On our lives
All our lives

Because friend, friend, friend, enemy
Friend, friend, friend, enemy

Who really knows who's winning the most
Who set the stage and who holds the rope
Who really cares who matters the most
Who’s set to gain when clearing the smoke

You started living with yourself for while
You started feeling like a fish on the line
You got the tempo but you don't get the time
And you won't
No you won't
\\\\\\\\\\\////
I got a feeling, I gotta go
Another reason, another groan

I changed my mind

Now wait a minute, I misspoke
I wouldn't think it, it wouldn't float

I, I don't know why
I, change my mind

I know you, it's all about a feeling, feeling
I know you, and I know how you're feeling

It could be different, I'd love you so
I see no future I see no hope

I changed my mind

I gotta see ya, I gotta go
I really need ya, I really don't

I, I don't know why
I, don't even try

I know you, it's all about a feeling, feeling
I know you, and I know how you're feeling
\\\\\\\\\\\\
I’ll believe it, when I see it
I'll believe it when they put out the sun

Why talk about it, why walk around it
Just step inside until it's all said and done

I know I’m on the outside, wherever I go
It’s gone beyond a landslide, I’d rather go home, go home

Nice to meet you, nice to leave you
Thanks for the memories and thanks for the love

There’s an answer, out on the highway
Looks to me like I should be only one

My hopes, my soul, my dark side, primed to explode
A void, a hole, a landmine, everyone knows

I know, my faults, my downsides, more than you know
I'll be the one to get right, all on my own
I know I'm on the outside
I know I'll find the upside
I know who I am on the inside
More than you know
Wherever I go, wherever I go
I'll know
\\\\\\\\\\\\/
Last time around, the sun goes down, remain in place
Land falling down, there's no sound, left to hear

There's a time for everything to end
We can't try to even understand

It's no use in trying to pretend
There's a time for everything to end

Light, fades away, no more days, left to lead
Time, said and done, no rerun, no conceit

There’s your life and maybe there’s a plan
Sometimes they just weren't hand in hand

There's no time to try and comprehend
It can go as fast as it began

The waves, The tide, the sky
In space, in time, the ride, was fun

There's a time for everything to end
We can't try to even understand

There's no use in trying to pretend
There's a time for everything to end
\\\\\\\\\\\\//
Eminence, when you think that you're ahead of it
And you needed more than you could get
There's a breakdown of the sentiment
And you feel you've had enough

Get out of the way, get out of your own way
Get out of the way, get out of the way, get out of your own way

Reverence, to the ones who make your life a mess
As you give up your inheritance
There's a shakedown on the precipice
Point the finger, pass the buck

Get out of the way, get out of your own way
Get out of the way, get out of the way, get out of your own way
\\\\\\\\\\\\///
Well I’ve been playing by the rules, and I just can’t get out of bed
I’ve been saying more than you, but I don’t have any more left
Yeah I'm a sucker and a fool and I'm in way over my head
I’m on a different point of view, but I’m just so out of my depth

And I go...

Well I can play it kinda cool but I'm just like anyone else
And I'm ok to play the fool If you don't think anything less
I’ve been deflated through and through but I can't have any regrets
Well I've been playing by the rules, but I don’t know who’s keeping check

So I say...
\\\\\\\\\\\\////
Is it alright to be myself again
Can I finally be myself again
I don’t need a reason to find
I'm beginning to feel myself again
I’m leaving the memory behind
So I can finally be myself again, auf wiedersehen, I’ll see you there some better day

Cards on the table vanity off to the side
Always been able to get myself back to a stride
Time’s an eraser and reverie speaks for itself
Sign your own waiver and you’ll never be somebody else
You’ll never be somebody else

Is it alright to be myself again
Can I finally be myself again
I don’t need a reason to find
I'm beginning to feel myself again
I’m leaving the memory behind
So I can finally be myself again, auf wiedersehen, I’ll see you there some better day

Almost a stranger and even to those that I know
I'm the remainder of memories thrown to the cold
Life is too painful when honesty comes at a price
And lies aren’t fatal unless they're the four letter kind
Unless they're the four letter kind
\\\\\\\\\\\\\
Someone jumped the gun
Someone knew it all along
Someone jumped the gun
Someone really fucked it up

Yeah, what a shame, gotta pay the petty tax
Yeah, just the same, you know you've really gotta laugh

Someone jumped the gun
Some things better left undone
Someone jumped the gun
Someone ruined all the fun

Yeah, who's to say, you never really could get back
Yeah, gotta break, I don't know, maybe I'll be back

Someone jumped the gun
\\\\\\\\\\\\\/
Really no time, living on borrowed time
Not until they see what you've been through
Never looked back, never went back
Such a waste of life, but who allowed you, unwound you, threw you to the ground
That now you'd choose to put them down

(They’ll know who you are)
Never got time, never was given time
(Why’d you go so far)
This is what becomes of those who break
(They’ll know who you are)
Never know why, never know peace of mind
(Why’d you go so far)
Traces of the ones you left around you, rounds used, lives you’ve run aground
The classroom, those who should be out of bounds
Confused, deep wounds, can they heal somehow
Our minds are broken and beat down

(They’ll know who you are)
Nothing set right, everyone choose a side
(Why’d you go so far)
The advertising's free, and since they found you, crowned you, said your name aloud
Profound fools will want the same thing now

(Lives you’ve run aground)
(Should be out of bounds)
(Can they heal somehow)
(Lives you’ve run aground)
\\\\\\\\\\\\\//
How many days has it been now, hard to tell
The sand it stings and beats my brow, beats me down
The cool night wind betrays a sound, just a sound
Oh stars above don't leave me now, how about now

I hear you, I hear the sound
I see you, I see the ground
I'm falling, I won't go down
I'm leaving

The fire's cold
The days are slow
The final crumb
The setting sun
Setting sun, yeah

My visions blur the here and now, to be found
My final days, my first few sounds, here and now

My father, my fallow ground
The reasons, my mother found
I'm sorry, but not right now
I'm leaving

An only son
The fire's gone
What's done is done
The setting sun
\\\\\\\\\\\\\///
It's time to be extra cautious
A sigh of relief, but don't get thoughtless
I'm getting old and you'll be older too

It’s time to see what you’ve created,
Resigned to be, nauseated
Sit back for the show, they wanted the real you

It used to be less complicated
When you’re talking to me, is it real or traded
And now I suppose you’ll be going too

Keep it together
Gotta keep it together
\\\\\\\\\\\\\////
The sun is up but the sky is gray
The birds are flying away
They'll pick you up, they'll pull you away
They'll give you more than they take

When it's too tough
The time is up

Forgetter
Forgetter
Forget, it’ll make you feel better

The same old stuff on the same old day
The light that keeps you awake
And there's no doubt that your troubles will stay
If you don't turn them away

They'll turn you on
They'll turn you down

Forgetter
Forgetter
Forget, it’ll make you feel better

It's all so small
From far enough
The siren's call

Forgetter
Forgetter
Forget, it’ll make you feel better
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
Inside you there's a sound that you could make
The right tune can clear a rainy day
It finds you like a dog that lost its way
Reminds you of the one that got away

It's time to look at what we celebrate
The trite fools who would throw it all away
The ones who give some meaning to their pain
Remind you everything will be ok

Thinking about the rain
I’ve been thinking about the rain

The time you give to something you can't fake
Defines you and the feelings you relate
It grounds you to a world that you create
Without you, everything's a bit more gray

I’ve been thinking about the rain
I’ve been thinking about the rain

Without you there's a price that we all pay
The sound you
You make
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\/
In the morning air
At the window, yeah
In the morning
At the window

These dreams, like a scene from your old life
Through a cold and distant light
There's a place, but there's no time

These dreams, take apart your shallow mind
In a way you can't define
Like a bullet from the sky

I know, I know, I know you can never get it back
So don't be late and take another crack
I won't complain as long as I can dream

These dreams, when you live a double life
And the stakes are just too high
Grenadine and shepherd's pie

These dreams, they can really change your life
Are you ready for the dive
Through the shallows and the cries

Of those who chose to put it on their back
The highs, the lows that make so many crack
And so it goes, as long as I can dream

As long as I can dream

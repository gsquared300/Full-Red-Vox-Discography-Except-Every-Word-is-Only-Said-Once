you
better
take

you'll
find
that
it's
something

that

the
time

the
effort
worth
the
trouble
of
going
through
I
wish
you
luck
along

\//
so
I
got
a
little
older
I
got
everything
I
thought
I'd
need
I
got
a
little
wiser
But
I'm
not
everything
I
thought
I'd
be
Think
you'd
be
better
off
in
bed
Reliving
the
past
inside
your
head
No
I 
don't
have
a
lot
to
leave
And
I'm
not
good
enough
to
Was
it
worth
the
time
you
spent?
I
don't
think
so
Was
it
worth
the
time
that
went
I
told
you
so
Was
it
worth
the
time
you
spent
I
don't
think
so
Could
have
been
worse
is
what
you
said
So
I
got
another
concept
I
think
it's
my
best
idea
in
years
Gonna
work
a
little
harder
Gonna
give
it
the
very
best
of
me
Think
of
all
the
shit
that
came
and
went
You'd
think
it's
the
wheel
you'd
reinvent
I
guess
I'll
throw
it
all
away
Because
I'm
not
good
enough
to
Was
it
worth
the
time
you
spent
I
don't
think
so
Wasn't
worth
the
time
that
went
I
told
you
so
Was
it
worth
the
time
you
spent
I
don't
think
so
Could
have
been
worse
is
what
you
said
Sounds
like
the
notes
you
played
were
wrong
And
you
should
give
up
before
too
long
But
if
I
pretend
to
believe
That
I'm
good
enough
to
Was
it
worth
the
time
you
spent
I
do
think
so
It
was
worth
the
time
I
spent
It
was
I
know
It
was
worth
the
time
It
was
worth
the
time
And
now
the
voice
is
fucking
dead

I
got
you
a
job
in
the
city
now
ooh
But
what
you
want
isn't
what
you
found
Such
a
frown
We're
taking
the
bus
and
you're
going
downtown
Bet
you
tried
to
burn
this
opportunity
down
To
the
ground
So
sorry
so
sad
You've
got
it
so
bad

friends
are
in

Still
playing
I
got
you
a
job
in
the
city
now
Slaving
all
day
for
your
pennies
now
Should
be
proud
When
I
was
young
the
sweat
fell
off
of
my
brow
Got
me
a
car
and
I
bought
me
a
house
When
I
was
younger
I
had
it
all
figured
out
And
that
you're
older
there
should
never
be
a
doubt
I
want
you
to
notice
I
want
you
to
notice
I
want
you
to
know
just
what
I've
done
for
you
So
sorry
so
sad
You've
got
it
so
bad
Your
friends
are
in
the
band
Still
playing
I
got
you
a
job
in
the
city
now
It's
time
to
come
down
from
the
top
of
that
cloud
Come
on
down
You're
punching
the
clock
for
twenty
odd
years
now
Above
and
beyond
but
still
on
the
ground
Take
a
bow
You
got
it
you're
in
You're
selling
your
skin
Goodbye
to
the
boys
Put
away

been
writing
on
your
ghost
page
babe
And
I
would
check
it
every
day
We'll
be
together
till
the
end
of
time
I'll
be
scrolling
through
your
shrine
Rain
hell
rain
it
on
top
of
me
Cause
right
now
no
one
is
stopping
me
Rain
hell
rain
it

Cause

And
every
time
that
I
feel
afraid
Afraid
of
what
I'll
say
I
towed
the
line
and
now
I'm
alone
It
doesn't
mean
I
don't
belong
It's
hard
to
believe
you
when
you
say
I'll
never
leave
you
I
could
be
wrong
but
it's
been
a
long
lonely
night
And
any
time
That
I
feel
the
pain
Out
in
the
pouring
rain
You
told
a
lie
and
now
I'm
alone
I
couldn't
see
when
I
was
wrong
It's
hard
to
believe
you

I'll

Afraid

Once
I
dreamt
I
wasn't
far
away
from
you
You
irradiate
the
sky
you
fell
into
And
I
just
couldn't
believe
it
I
was
changed
or
deranged
Now
am
I
the
one
who's
head
is
in
the
ground
But
I
don't
know
what
any
of
this
means
to
me
Turn
out
the
lights
and
it's
all
so
clear
to
see
All
of
this
time
I
was
holding
out
it
seems
Go
back
to
bed
and
I'll
meet
you
in
a
dream
You
when
any
other
voice
would
make
me
blue
And
you
you
complicate
the
life
you
stepped
into
And
I
just
couldn't
receive
it
I
was
closed
predisposed
Now
am
I
the
one
who
ran
away
from
you
But
I
don't
know
what
any
of
this
means
to
me
Turn
out

it's

I
don't

when
I
would
see
your
face
again
Brighter
than
all
of
the
smiles
that
came
and
went
You
fell
like
a
star
in
the
Milky
Way
back
when
But
when
you're
a
dream
you
can't
make
it
to

In
a
forest
past
the
harvest
lived
a
troll
named
Drizzle
Drozzle
Dum
His
obsession
with
possession
led
him
to
an
awfully
tragic
end
One
bright
morning
after
yawning
Drizzle
Drozzle
stole
a
goblin's
lunch
He
was
hungry
and
his
tummy
gave
the
signal
for
him
to
have
a
munch
Tasty
snail
stew
quite
tough
to
chew
Drizzle
ate
well
then
he
went
to
bed
Dreams
of
dragons
gnomes
and half-lings
elven
woodsmen
began
to
fill
his
head
Soon
the
goblin
to
his
chagrin
found
his
food
was
taken
by
the
troll
So
he
set
out
there
was
no
doubt
maimed
poor
Drizzle
hung
him
from
a
pole
Drizzle
Drozzle
got
his
fulfill
but
his
actions
led
him
to
his
fall
That's
his
story
and
I'm
sorry
if
you
can 
relate
to
him
at
all

The
world
won't
wait
for
procrastination
You'll
never
bleed
if
you
never
fight
But
how
much
worth
the
pain
is
elation
Part
the

and
release
the

The

If

aberration
Define

Late
last
night
or
was
it
morning
Outside
the
rain
was
pouring
I
stumbled
out
I
hit
the
ground
It's
a
hell
of
a 
scene
but
there's
no
story
Designed
in
all
it's
glory
To
set
you
up
and
knock
you
down
Just
a
reflection
on
my
bitterness
Why
plant
the
seed
and
not
do
the
rest
Just
a
distraction
from
the
meaningless
I'd
rather
bleed
than
settle
for
less
Was
told
at
the
time
to
just
keep
going
You'll
fly
but
don't
stop
rowing
Reached
for
the
moon
and
hit
the
ground
Is
this
a
chip
upon
my
shoulder
As
heavy
as
a
boulder
When
all
the
world
owes
you
a
crown
Just
a
reflection
on
my
emptiness
You
don't
succeed
by
chasing
success
No
reputation
is
worth
all
this
mess
I'd
rather
bleed
than
settle
for
less
Just
a
reflection
on
my
happiness
Only
compete
with
yourself
at
your
best
A
separation
from
the
self
I
possess
Just
let
it
be
and
settle
for
less

You
gotta
live
a
little

a
long
cold
history
If
I
seem
uncomfortable
it's
because
you're
just
too
close
to
me
Past
the
living
room
a
rose
tinted
tomb
And
a
ghost
staring
back
at
me
If
it

impossible
it's
because

Memories
Lie
In
a
little
while
I'll
be
out
of
style
Out
of
grace
and

When
I
feel
disposable
I'll
pretend
it
meant
something
to
me
Everyone
you

passing
on

Plays
a

it
can
rewrite
history
Memories

change
with
passing

You

but
riding
the
tide
Still
afloat
The
wings
of
a
butterfly
a
skip
of
the
stone
If
it
would've
gone
the
way
I
thought
it
would
go
I
could
be
shoveling
shit
to
pay
loans
I
don't
know
\\\\///
I
woke
real
tired
with
the
earth
for
a
bed
Can't
remember
nothing
but
the
colors
black
and
red
Well
a
little
bit
of
fun
never
hurt
no
one
Now
I
need
shelter
from
the
raging
desert
sun
Dragging
my
bones
to
the
side
of
the
road
Pounding
in
my
head
so
loud
it
could
explode
I'm
heading
on
back
to
Reno
On
the
way
all
the
way
Heading
on
back
to
Reno
Every
day
get
away
Heading
on
back
to
Reno
And
I
say
yeah
Escaping
into
vice
in
the
city
in
the
sand
But
what
I
threw
away
is
right
back
in
my
hand
Lost
a
lot
of
time
in
the
land
of
the
drought
Chasing
down
a
feeling
that
I
could
not
live
without
Desert's
gone
cold
in
the
dark
of
the
night
Looking
to
the
distance
I
can
see
a
bit
of
light
Is
it
light
I'm
heading
in
back
to
Reno
On
the
way
all
the
way
Heading
on
back
to
Reno
Every
day
get
away
Heading
on
back
to
Reno
And
I
say
yeah
\\\\////
Made
myself
a
little
garden
to
grow
myself
my
only
friends
Got
myself
a
brand
new
start
and
oh
no
I
screwed
it
up
again
Guess
I'm
staying
up
all
night
in
my
mind
but
out
of
sight
I'm
to
blame
for
this
I
hide
away
until
the
day
is
through
I
will
pay
for
this
won't
find
a
way
to
push
the
blame
on
you
I
won't
run
from
this
hide
away
until
the
day
is
through
Can't
believe
my
eyes
this
morning
I
found
a
plot
of
weeds
instead
Yesterday
was
so
adoring
my god
so easy
to
offend
I
would
rather
fly
than
fight
close
my
eyes
and
hang
on
tight
I'm
not
to
blame
for
this
I
hide
away
until
the
day
is
through
I
will
run
from
this
I'll
find
a
way
to
push
to
blame
on
you
I'll
be
all
right
tomorrow
hide
away
until
the
day
is
through
It's
so
simple
It's
as
easy
as
can
be
Make
a
monster
lock
it
up
throw
away
the
key
In
the
backyard
buried
deep
underneath
the
tree
There's
a
monster
taking
root
in
the
property
In
the
garden
where
the
weeds
are
now
growing
free
In
the
garden
where
my
friends
plot
to
bury
me
There's
a
jungle
it's
as
far
as
the
eye
can
see
Overgrown
now
it's
no
longer
a
fantasy
But
it's
too
late
by
the
time
that
I
realize
I
can't
see
now
cause
the
dirt
is
up
to
my
eyes
\\\\\
And
if
you
don't
find
what
you've
been
looking
for
you've
got
to
learn
to
forgive
and
forget
And
if
you
can't
get
up
off
the
cold
hard
floor
you've
got
to
learn
to
forgive
and
forget
And
If
you
can't
find
what
you've
been
living
for
you've
got
to
learn
to
forgive
and
forget
And
if
you
can't
let
go
of
your
dirty
thought
you've
got
to
learn
to
forgive
and
forget
And
if
you
can't
get
over
your
broken
heart
you've
got
to
learn
to
forgive
and
forget
And
if
you
don't
know
how
you
got
this
far
you've
got
to
learn
to
forgive
and
forget
And
if
there's
no
hope
left
of
a
another
start
you've
got
to
learn
to
forgive
yourself
\\\\\/
You
can
throw
your
conscience
away
just
to
land
a
good
part
in
the
play
Maybe
there's
a
reason
that
you
feel
so
empty
Broken
bottles
and
junk
on
the
floor
its
hard
to
notice
when
your
eye's
on
the
score
If
you
burn
a
picture
to
obtain
the
ashes
a
bit
of
wind
could
blow
what's
left
away
You
can
leave
your
heart
at
the
door
you
can
waste
all
your
time
wanting
more
You
can
play
a
victim
to
a
broken
mirror
You
can
sell
yourself
for
a
dime
step
on
anyone
who
borrows
your
time
You
can
be
a
hero
to
your
own
reflection
you
can
fill
your
head
with
empty
praise
If
you
burn
a
picture
to
obtain
the
ashes
you
resign
to
throw
yourself
away
There's
another
light
\\\\\//
Alone
and
stranded
out
of
time
Are
you
receiving
me
alright
Out
in
the
cold
Arcturan
night
Why
are
you
leaving
me
behind
Lost
to
the
void
all
sense
of
time
Was
there
no
meaning
to
my
life
The
air
I
breathe
is
running
dry
Don't
think
I'll
last
another
night
I
can't
hear
you
if
you're
calling
out
my
name
I
can't
see
you
and
I'm
feeling
just
the
same
I
can't
see
you
I
can't
hear
you
I'll
believe
it
when
I
die
When
I
was
young
I
dreamed
I'd
fly
I
wish
I'd
had
the
nerve
to
try
I
see
my
life
before
my
eyes
All
that
I've
loved
and
I've
despised
I
can't
hear
you
if
you're
calling
out
my
name
I
can't
see
you
and
I'm
feeling
just
the
same
I
can't
see
you
I
can't
hear
you
I'll
believe
it
when
I
die
Well
I'm
a
million
miles
away
from
the
whos
and
whys
that
used
to
matter
throw
it
all
away
you
could
throw
it
all
away
If
I
had
just
one
more
day
I
would
speak
my
mind
goodbye
forever
all
I
have
to
say
and
I'd
mean
all
that
I'd
say
And
to
those
that
I've
betrayed
before
I
close
my
eyes
and
sleep
forever
Sorry
for
the
pain
but
you
might've
done
the
same
And
I'd
thank
you
for
today
and
for
all
the
moments
not
remembered
wish
I
could
repay
but
you're
a
million
miles
away
This
is
the
captain
of
the
Pike
Are
you
receiving
me
alright
